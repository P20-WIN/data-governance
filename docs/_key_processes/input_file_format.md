# Input File Format

To facilitate identity resolution in an interagency data request, each Participating Agency must structure the input file so that there is one unique record per Individual represented. Data that may have been pulled from a dimensional data source will be flattened to produce an input file in this format. Additionally, the Participating Agency should structure the file with a unique generic ID to each unique record in the file that identifies the Participating Agency which is providing the information.

Participating Agencies Data Stewards should follow the standardized formatting requirements when preparing a data file for matching. The Data Integration Hub has the right to reject any data that does not meet these standards.

For matching files – Files should be in a tab delimited text file. There should not be quotations around text fields.

For analytical files – Files should be in the format requested and approved for the given data request.
