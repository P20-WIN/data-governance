# Executive Board Membership 
The P20 WIN Executive Board shall consist of the agency head of all participating agencies or state organizations that are contributing data to P20 WIN. Executive Board members collaborate and work to secure resources for the data sharing process and its efficient operation, thereby adding value to their respective agencies and to Connecticut as a whole.   

While membership within P20 WIN is not restricted to Executive Branch state agencies, the P20 WIN Executive Board Chairperson must be a State official or employee. As Chairperson, they facilitate all Executive Board meetings, champion the P20 WIN Data Sharing process, and work with all Participating Agency leaders and political leaders to assure agency-to-agency coordination and to further data sharing to improve services provided to the residents of Connecticut. A new Chairperson is elected every two years.
