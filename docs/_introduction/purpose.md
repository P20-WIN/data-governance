# Purpose

Data governance creates the rules and guidelines that make it possible to share data and is central to safeguarding data as a public good. Data governance is both an organizational process and a structure; it establishes responsibility for data, organizing staff to collaboratively and continuously improve data quality through the systemic creation and enforcement of policies, roles, responsibilities, and procedures. 

This Data Governance Manual documents the policies, structure and processes for P20 WIN data governance. This manual will be updated as agency and state priorities evolve.
