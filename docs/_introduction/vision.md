# Vision & Overview of P20 WIN 
The Vision for P20 WIN is to inform sound policies and practice through secure sharing of critical longitudinal data across participating agencies to ensure that individuals successfully navigate supportive services and educational pathways into the workforce.

P20 WIN was established so that multiple cross-agency data sets could be linked securely to create longitudinal views of student experiences. Since its inception in 2014, the P20 WIN system has expanded to include 15 member agencies and have fulfilled data requests looking at student outcomes to disconnected youth outcomes.  

The following list outlines key goals for P20 WIN: 

1.	Establish a longitudinal data system that includes supportive services, secondary and postsecondary education, and pathways into the workforce.
2.	Institute clear high-level, agency-wide sponsorship of data governance.
3.	Integrate accountability for successful data management throughout all levels of each Participating Agency.
4.	Ensure data security for confidential information at rest and during transmission and the protection of individual privacy.
5.	Provide clear definitions of user roles, system access and approval processes.
6.	Link data to address policy questions that would otherwise remain unanswered, through the development of a shared learning agenda.
7.	Introduce governance flexibility to include additional data points and datasets.
