## Metadata and data dictionaries 

Metadata is structured data about data. High quality metadata provides helpful context about the data’s creation, quality, and uses and is key to improving data discovery. Metadata helps to answer the question “what is the data about?” by providing more detail about various characteristics of the data, including information about the data source, update frequency, and level of detail. Dataset metadata elements should include:

- Human-readable name of the dataset
- A description of what the dataset entails 
- The number of rows 
- Temporal coverage 
- The update frequency  
- Any unique identifier

Related guidance for metadata on the open data portal can be found here. Participating Agencies should provide key metadata to accompany the interagency Data Dictionary fields. The Data Governing Board is responsible for developing, documenting and monitoring Data Definitions and Metadata for shared Data Elements within the cross-agency Data Dictionary. The Operating Group works with the Data Governing Board to ensure that the Data Dictionary for each Participating Agency is complete and up-to-date.
