# User Training
Another best practice for agencies sharing PII is to verify that the recipients of the data have received appropriate training. In addition to conducting agency specific training and information sessions, the U.S. Department of Education has resources available through the Family Privacy Compliance Office (FPCO) Privacy Technical Assistance Center (PTAC).  

PTAC provides access to free webinars and training modules which can be utilized by the participating agencies, UCHC and DAS-BEST to inform employees about the sensitivity of the data being shared and to help them protect PII from being disclosed.
