# Learning agenda 

All policies and actions of the Data Governing Board shall further the priorities outlined in the P20 WIN Learning Agenda. The Operating Group, with the Participating Agencies, will support the continued progress in each area of focus: college and career success, student readiness, financial aid, workforce training, and overcoming barriers to success. These areas have a broad scope that should allow for a wide array of research projects and involve many of the participating agencies. 

The Learning Agenda is subject to change as state and agency data needs evolve; therefore, the Data Governing Board may propose changes to this document for the Executive Board to approve. Agencies are also encouraged to develop agency-specific learning agendas. The agenda can be updated at any time, but the Executive Board conducts an annual review of the agenda at their November meeting. 

## College and Career Success

The purpose of this research is to provide information to support course placement decisions at colleges and universities and to provide information to families in Connecticut about the probability of admission to four-year institutions.

## Student Readiness

It is essential to provide multi-faceted supports so that all students can achieve the highest levels of academic readiness. Research will focus on three critical educational systems/transitions: early childhood to k-12; elementary/middle to high school within K-12; and high school to post-secondary. It is vital for this research to not just include mainstream education data, but also to include social services, child welfare, housing, family life, and adult education data to get a fuller picture of student experiences.

## Financial Aid

Connecticut must have a better understanding of the dynamics of financial aid and the outcomes of state financial aid grant recipients so that we can maximize the opportunity for students with limited state resources. 

## Workforce Training

The success of the state’s workforce education training system, which is critical to the state’s economic development, requires using data to inform decision-making and programming.  The state is working to develop standards around measuring the return on investment (ROI) for Connecticut’s public workforce training programs. 

## Overcoming Barriers to Success

Embedded in each of the prior topics is the need to help individuals who face barriers to success or who are at risk of falling behind due to conditions such as homelessness or engagement with the child welfare system. P20 WIN has expanded to include state agencies that address social services, homelessness, and child welfare. Establishing these connections allows us to understand the degree to which residents face additional challenges and to develop programs that support these students and move individuals and families into cycles of success.
