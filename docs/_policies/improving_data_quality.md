# Process for Improving Data Quality
Because data quality issues can develop at any point during collection, storage or transformation, data quality improvement processes need to function at multiple levels and across the data sharing structure.  In order to prevent and rectify data quality issues as they become known, Participating Agencies will do the following:

- Ensure that data users and data owners have representation on the Data Steward Committee to help identify and improve data quality.  
- Identify a process whereby the agency Data Governing Board representative and that agencyâ€™s Data Stewards have designated time for regular communication about data quality issues.
- Utilize a log as provided by the P20 WIN Manager for identifying and tracking data quality issues pertinent to P20-WIN data quality.
- Have a continued effort to maintain and improve documentation about shared data elements.
