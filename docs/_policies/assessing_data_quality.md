# Assessing Data Quality
P20 WIN is a system where the quality of linked data depends on multiple factors.  As shared data is linked using probabilistic data matching routines there will be intrinsic variance between matches from one query to another.  For the Data Governing Board and the Approved Data Requestor to be confident that the linked data is of sufficient quality to produce a valid audit or evaluation, the following factors need to be considered for each matched data set.

- How many fields were available for conducting the match?
- What is the confidence interval for matches made?
- What percentage of records is populated or data elements with null values?
- What is the history for data elements with no value or many null values?
- Have the data fields been consistently updated?
- Is the data field new?
- Is a null value normal for that element?
- What is the meaning of un-matched records?
- Are any data elements used in the query actually proxies for better measures?  If yes, does the inclusion of proxies significantly dilute or skew the results?)
- Is there an inherent bias in the results based upon the presence or absence of subgroups within the population being queried?	
- Can any concerns about data quality be sufficiently articulated and communicated to the intended audience?
- Does the potential for meaningful and important insight override concerns about data quality to warrant continued analysis?
