# Data Access and Privacy Policies

The Data Access & Privacy Policy is articulated all data sharing agreements that have been established between the participating and hosting agencies. Together these agreements form the policy that establishes how data linked through P20 WIN will be managed so that access is limited, data are secure, and privacy is maintained. Official documents are located at: http://www.ct.edu/initiatives/p20win#process. The language in this section is intended to highlight key information from these data sharing agreements and provide additional detail as to how data access and privacy will be managed in practice.  

P20 WIN and its participating agencies adhere to the confidentiality requirements of both federal state laws including but not limited to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), the National School Lunch Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) and state and federal labor law. The following definitions pertinent to addressing privacy issues are derived from these and other related documents.
