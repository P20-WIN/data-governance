# Participating Agency Audits
A best practice for data sharing systems where Personally Identifiable Data (PII) is being exchanged is to allow agencies sharing PII to conduct audits or other monitoring activities of the authorized representative’s policies, procedures and systems to ensure that data are as secure as possible.

The MOA between each participating agency and DOL allow the participating agencies to perform an on-site audit and inspection of the system whenever, and as often as, the participating agencies deem appropriate.  The audits would be conducted to ensure that the confidentiality requirements of the MOA and all applicable laws and regulations, including applicable amendments are being satisfied.

Likewise, the MOA between the participating agencies and the Authorized Representative who is the Approved Data Requestor also allow the participating agencies to perform an on-site audit and inspection of the Data Requestor’s system whenever, and as often as, the participating agencies deem appropriate.  These audits would also be conducted to ensure the confidentiality requirements of the MOA and all applicable laws and regulations, including applicable amendments are being satisfied.

Similarly, both DOL and the Approved Data Requestor have a responsibility to monitor those persons with access to confidential information to determine whether the job responsibilities of those persons continue to require access.  They should immediately remove access for any person who is determined to no longer need it and take all necessary steps to ensure that any records which are in the possession or control of such persons are timely destroyed as provided in this Agreement.
