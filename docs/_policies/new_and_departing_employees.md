# New and Departing Employees 
When a Participating Agency has a new employee who will be involved in an existing data request, the Participating Agency is required to inform the Program Manager before the new individual can have access to data linked through P20 WIN. The Participating Agency is responsible for teaching the new employee or contractor about the necessity for and processes to maintain data privacy and security. The Program Manager will be responsible for obtaining a NDA for the new individual and facilitating modification of any existing relevant data request documents to enable the new hire to participate in the audit or evaluation as necessary.

When an employee or contractor who had access to P20 WIN data leaves a Participating Agency, the agency who is losing the staff person is required to inform the Program Manager and other Participating Agencies of the departure. This is especially important if the individual had access to uploading or downloading data through secure FTP so that the individualâ€™s account can be deleted or password changed as necessary.  Notification is required within 24 hours.
