# Defining Data Quality for P20 WIN 
In general, data are of high quality if the pieces of information necessary for a specific purpose are available when needed. Given a specific need, the right data fields need to be identified, defined, gathered and readily available. If the data fields are inexactly described, gathered incompletely or not ready when needed, the quality of the overall dataset is affected.  Achieving a high level of data quality involves checking data and conducting audits throughout the processes of data generation, collection and storage.
