# P20 WIN Data Governance Structure

The P20 WIN Data Governance structure has three governing bodies: the Executive Board, the Data Governing Board, and the Resident Advisory Board. These groups represent a three-tier leadership system.  

The **Executive Board** has ultimate policy decision-making authority for the P20 WIN Data Sharing process. The Executive Board can create standing or special committees (e.g., legal committee) when necessary.  

The **Data Governing Board** enforces policies set forth by the Executive Board related to cross-agency data management, including but not limited to, data confidentiality and security in conformance with applicable law.  

Finally, the **Resident Advisory Board** advises and guides the Executive Board and the Data Governing Board on how to communicate the work and mission to State residents.  

Together these groups provide a framework for system leadership, implementation, and improvement. Independent of the governance structure, **Data Stewards** are the staff at the Participating Agencies that work closely with the data available for request. Data Stewards from each Participating Agency are encouraged to join the regular Data Stewards meetings to focus on the implementation of system policy and to determine the availability, security, and quality of data.
