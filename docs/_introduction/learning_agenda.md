# Learning Agenda

P20 WIN is a unique state resource for answering critical policy questions that require data from more than one agency; therefore, data requests to P20 WIN will be approved only if they require input from more than one participating agency. Requests should also align with either a participating agency’s individual research agenda or the P20 WIN Learning Agenda as defined here. Researchers interested in requesting data from P20 WIN must remember that data requests utilizing education data are only allowed if the purpose of the request is to audit or evaluate Federal- or State-supported education programs or for compliance with federal legal requirements related to these programs.

These areas have a broad scope that should allow for a wide array of research projects and involve many of the participating agencies.

This P20 WIN Learning Agenda, proposed by the Data Governing Board and approved by the Executive Board, relies on each participating agency identifying key policy questions and research priorities. The Learning Agenda is subject to change as state and agency data needs evolve; therefore, the Data Governing Board may propose changes to this document for the Executive Board to approve. Agencies are also encouraged to develop agency-specific learning agendas.

This version of the P20 WIN Learning Agenda highlights the key topics and guiding questions that are priorities for Participating Agencies. The topics for analysis support a better understanding of how our programs and services affect Connecticut residents.
