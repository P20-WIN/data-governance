# Executive Board Decision-making Process
In order to maintain a functioning system and address P20 WIN issues in a timely manner, the Executive Board adopts bylaws and meets quarterly.  Executive Board meetings are convened through the P20 WIN Operating Group and attendance at meetings may be in person or remote. Regular meetings are accessible to the public. 

Written notice of all meetings is provided to the Executive Board via email, at least one week in advance of a Regular Meeting and with as much prior notice as possible for Special Meetings. Each notice will be accompanied by an agenda of the meeting and will be listed on the Secretary of State’s public calendar. 

Quorum. Two-thirds of the Executive Board members shall constitute a quorum at a meeting and is necessary to transact business. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the Executive Board members present at the meeting may adjourn the meeting and reschedule the meeting to another time without further notice. If a quorum is represented at the rescheduled meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally scheduled.  The Executive Board members present at a meeting represented by a quorum may continue to transact business until adjournment, even if the withdrawal of some Executive Board members results in representation of less than a quorum.  

Voting. For issues that require a formal vote, all members of the Executive Board must vote in favor of the issue in order for the issue to pass unless specifically noted otherwise in these Bylaws or the E-MOU. 

Proxy voting. Members may designate a proxy to attend and participate on their agency’s behalf, by sending a letter designating the individual and specifying the duration of the proxy assignment, to the Secretary, before the start of the meeting.
