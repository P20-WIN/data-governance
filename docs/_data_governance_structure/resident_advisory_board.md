# Resident Advisory Board

Data sharing by governmental agencies should incorporate the knowledge and expertise of state residents. Many state agencies have established advisory groups seeking to gain insight from the community and their lived experiences.  

The Executive Board will establish a Resident Advisory Board with members representing residents of Connecticut who receive or have received state services and benefits. The role of the Resident Advisory Board is to provide advice and guidance to the Executive Board and the Data Governing Board on how to effectively communicate its work and mission to State residents.  

## Responsibilities:

1. Advise the Participating Agencies in earning public trust in the work of the Data Sharing process.  
2. Attend Data Governing Board meetings as needed.  
3. Assist the Data Sharing process to ensure that the P20 WIN promotes equity and that research efforts do not negatively impact consumers or families.  
4. Share insight on projects, policies, and procedures to prevent data misuse.
