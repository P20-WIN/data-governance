# Confidentiality  
Even though key identifiers such as name and Social Security Number are not retained in resulting data sets, the resulting data set will contain enough associated information about individuals that it might be possible for others who do not have personal knowledge of relevant details to identify a student with reasonable certainty. Therefore, participating agencies are required to safeguard the use, publication and disclosure of all information received through data sharing in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws regarding confidentiality.

Staff at participating agencies must conduct analysis in a manner which does not permit personal identification of individuals or their parents by anyone other than representatives of the participating agency. Participating agencies and their staff will take steps to maintain the confidentiality of data from the education records at all times by using appropriate disclosure avoidance techniques as defined in this policy.    

Only individuals who have been identified as having legitimate interests in the evaluation or who provide system support and who have also signed a “Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Statement” (NDA) will be allowed to access non-aggregated data from the matched data set for analysis.  It is important to note that persons who are not state government employees or officials may not have access to unit level wage data. Except for the resultant data sets that will be returned to the participating agencies and organizations, unit level data will not be disclosed.    

Results from any analysis or evaluation of education programs will be published in a manner that protects the privacy and confidentiality of the individuals involved. Tables will utilize disclosure avoidance techniques such as cell suppression, blurring, perturbation as appropriate. Care will be taken when utilizing cell suppression alone to employ additional methods to ensure that sensitive student counts cannot be found through the use of available percentages or data in other related tables. Data users will refer to the best practices outlined by the National Center for Education Statistics SLDS in Technical Brief 3 “Statistical Methods for Protecting Personally identifiable Information in Aggregate Reporting” to minimize, to the greatest extent possible, the risk that individuals could be identified.
