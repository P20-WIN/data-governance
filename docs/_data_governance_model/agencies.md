# Participating Agencies

The P20 WIN system does not collect or store data. Each participating agency is responsible for the data that reside in their respective systems until the approve a data request. Data is only shared for linking at the unit and aggregate level through P20 WIN for approved data requests.  

The system is designed with the flexibility to expand and include connections to additional organizations. Agencies interested in joining P20 WIN must have the authority to both collect data and release that data. The process for an agency or state organization to join P20 WIN is defined in Appendix 1 of the Enterprise Memorandum of Understanding and the “Protocol to Expand P20 WIN” within this manual.
