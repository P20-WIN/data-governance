# About the P20 WIN Data Governance Manual 
The P20 WIN Data Governance Manual details the structure, processes, roles and responsibilities that define its governance. This manual expands on the previous P20 WIN Data Governance Policy, which empowered the P20 WIN Data Governing Board to develop more detailed standards and processes for data management. This is a living document, and will be updated as agency and state priorities evolve. If a new policy is created or an existing policy changed, the Manual will be updated to include a copy of the new policy for reference.
