# System Audit Logs
Tracking system activity is important for establishing quality procedures, ensuring that security protocols are followed and for supporting system audits that may be conducted to improve system functionality.  The technical framework for P20 WIN is not automated; therefore, audit logs will be manually maintained.

## Events Tracked
After a data request is approved by the Data Governing Board and after a corresponding MOA is executed, data may be exchanged between agencies to conduct the approved audit or evaluation.  To support this process, the following information will be tracked.

### P20 WN Data Request Log
This log tracks Data Requests that are received by the Data Governing Board or P20 WIN Manager for consideration.  It is maintained by the P20 WIN Manager as the requests are processed according to the Data Request Management Procedure (Appendix B).  Monitored information includes:
-	P20 WIN Data Request Number
-	Name of Data Request
-	Date Request Received
-	Type of Submission (initial, continuation, repeat, modification)
-	Requestor
-	Requestor’s organization
-	Agencies impacted
-	Date of Data Governing Board decision
-	Decision status (received, approved, denied)
-	List of NDA’s needed

### Log for tracking Data Matches
