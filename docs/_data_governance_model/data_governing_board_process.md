# Decision-making Process
The Data Governing Board meets on a monthly basis. Regular meetings are accessible to the public. Written notice of all meetings is provided via email, at least one week in advance of a Regular Meeting and with as much prior notice as possible for Special Meetings. 

Quorum. Two-thirds of the Data Governing Board members shall constitute a quorum at the meeting and is necessary to transact business. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the Data Governing Board members present at the meeting may adjourn the meeting and reschedule the meeting to another time without further notice. If a quorum is represented at the rescheduled meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally scheduled. The Data Governing Board members present at a meeting represented by a quorum may continue the meeting without proceeding with votes, pertaining to the duties and responsibilities of the Board referenced in Article I, until adjournment, even if the withdrawal of some Data Governing Board members results in representation of less than a quorum. 

Voting. For issues that require a vote, all members of the Data Governing Board present must vote in favor of the issue in order for the issue to pass unless specifically noted otherwise in these Bylaws or the E-MOU.

Proxy voting. Members may designate a proxy to attend and participate on their agencyâ€™s behalf, by sending a letter designating the individual and specifying the duration of the proxy assignment, to the Secretary, before the start of the meeting.
