# Data Quality and Control Policies
As P20 WIN does not maintain a central combined data repository, the administrators of P20 WIN are not positioned to conduct systematic audits and quality control checks that are typical of traditional data repositories or warehouses. However, even though centralized data quality audits will not be conducted through P20 WIN, participating agencies and organizations will remain subject to regularly conducted audits by their own agencies and auditors and are responsible for ensuring that the data shared through P20 WIN are securely stored and of high quality.
