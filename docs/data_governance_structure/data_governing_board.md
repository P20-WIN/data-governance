# Data Governing Board

The Data Governing Board consists of one staff member from each Participating Agency who can deliver policy, resource, and staffing recommendations to support the Participating Agency in the Data Sharing process. Members work collaboratively to maintain the security of the Data Integration Hub. Once policies and resource commitments are approved by the Executive Board, the Data Governing Board members are responsible for implementing and enforcing these policies.

2. Review and approve Data Sharing Requests, data output, and resulting publications prior to release.  
3. Identify additional data stewards and subject matter experts to implement and improve the Data Sharing process.  
4. Provide guidance on the creation of regular reports mandated by the legislature.  
5. Establish a process to annually produce a report on the efforts of P20 WIN to promote equity throughout the data life cycle.  
6. Maintain a protocol for expanding the Data Sharing system to include additional agencies or data.  
7. Develop data standards and data cleansing processes.  
8. Develop, document, and monitor Data Definitions and Metadata for shared Data Elements.  
9. Evaluate the quality of the technical process for matching data and the quality of the data available.  
10. Develop policies and procedures to ensure data privacy, confidentiality, and security.  

## Member Expectations:
