# System Support
P20 WIN is a multi-agency collaborative with responsibility for maintaining and enhancing system operations, managing funds and producing information useful to the state for improving education and workforce outcomes.  As such staff is needed to provide support for P20 WIN.  

Most individuals involved in P20 WIN are employees of participating organizations.  The participating agencies are collective stewards for the system, and it is expected that their respective staff members will be actively engaged in maintaining and improving the system in accordance with the P20 E-MOU through the Executive Board, the Data Governing Board and the Data Steward Committee.
