# Metadata Management
The importance of metadata cannot be understated. Metadata provides contextual information about data elements that are necessary for the proper use of the elements. Metadata includes information about data fields critical to the data user in conducting analysis and to the programmer in maintaining and improving the data system. If the associated metadata fields are not completely or accurately defined for every data element, the potential for error in data usage increases.  

Through P20 WIN data elements are combined to create new pieces of information about a situation or issue from data sets originating at separate agencies. Each participating agency is responsible for maintaining the metadata about the data fields that they share through P20 WIN. It is expected that each agency will conduct data quality checks at the department, institution and system levels before making their data elements available to be linked with other agency data.
