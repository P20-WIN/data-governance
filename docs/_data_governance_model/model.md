# P20 WIN Data Governance Manual

The P20 WIN cross-agency data governance system provides the structure through which agency representatives can create and implement the necessary policies and procedures for a multi-agency data sharing system in order to address broad policy questions and state needs.

## Model
The P20 WIN data governance structure has three governing bodies that support discussions and decision making: the Executive Board, the Data Governing Board, and the Resident Advisory Board. Together these groups provide a framework for system leadership, policy creation, system implementation, maintenance and improvement. Together these groups provide a framework for system leadership, implementation, and improvement. Escalation of issues, questions and recommendations move up the model while the dissemination of decisions and implementation of P20 WIN initiatives moves down through the tiers of the model.

The Executive Board has ultimate decision-making authority for the P20 WIN Data Sharing process. The Executive Board can create standing or special committees (e.g., legal committee) when necessary. The Data Governing Board enforces policies set forth by the Executive Board related to cross-agency data management, including but not limited to, data confidentiality and security in conformance with applicable law. Finally, the Resident Advisory Board advises and guides the Executive Board and the Data Governing Board on how to communicate the work and mission to State residents.

Independent of the governance structure, Data Stewards are the staff at the Participating Agencies that work closely with the data available for request. Data Stewards from each Participating Agency are encouraged to join the regular Data Stewards meetings to focus on the implementation of system policy and to determine the availability, security, and quality of data.
