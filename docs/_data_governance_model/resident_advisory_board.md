# Resident Advisory Board 

Data sharing by governmental agencies should incorporate the knowledge and expertise of state residents. Many state agencies have established advisory groups seeking to gain insight from the community and their lived experiences. The role of the Resident Advisory Board is to provide advice and guidance to the Executive Board and the Data Governing Board on how to effectively communicate its work and mission to State residents.
