# Data Quality

The quality of the data in the P20 WIN ultimately determines the system’s overall value to state officials and external researchers. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) notes that key attributes of data quality are accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, and consistency1. Data inaccuracy refers to errors in records that are often the result of poor data entry practices and poor regulation of data accessibility2. Data completeness refers to the degree to which all data is available, which is often measured by the number of missing records3. Data validity refers to whether the data fields actually measure and reflect the systems or outcomes of interest. Data consistency refers to the degree the data is stable across both time and sources.

Integrated data systems must account for data inconsistencies across agencies. For example, an individual’s race as tracked in DSS Medicaid tables may not match the CCEH HMIS race identifier. Nonetheless, strong data governance policies can increase the value of such systems for key stakeholders. The Minnesota’s SLDS Governance Manual notes that “The key to maintaining high quality data is a proactive approach to data governance that requires establishing and regularly updating strategies for preventing, detecting, and correcting errors and misuses of data.”

P20 WIN Participating Agencies providing data do not ensure 100% accuracy of all fields and each Data Recipient accepts the quality of the data as received.4

The Executive Board can establish a data quality committee to introduce strategies to improve data standards. Other states have suggested participating agencies conduct regular data quality audits. For example, Virginia’s State Longitudinal Data System research sub-committee encourages participating agencies to develop some basic data quality reports that show range of values and frequency of missing values to accompany the master Data Dictionary. Other strategies include automatic edit checks that crosscheck the same field from year to year, reports on matching rates, and clean metadata for all possible extracts in the SLDS.
