# Data Request Process
The key to implementing the data access and Privacy policy is the Data Request Management Procedure as approved by the Data Governing Board. This procedure details how data requests can be made and how they will be processed. It is incorporated into the MOA which each Participating Agency has to participate in the system. There is a link to the full procedure in Appendix B and here:
