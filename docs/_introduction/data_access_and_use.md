# Data Access and Use Across P20 WIN 
State agencies and organizations that share data through P20 WIN are considered Participating Agencies and are accountable to the processes included in this manual. This manual is to be used as a roadmap when making decisions concerning the collection, integration, and use of data through P20 WIN, and it will be consistently reviewed for effectiveness and modified as policy and data needs change within the state.

Several supplemental documents have been developed, in addition to this manual, that can help one successfully coordinate and secure authorized access to data through P20 WIN.  

- The **Enterprise Memorandum of Understanding (E-MOU)** is a process document that establishes the governance structure, specifies privacy, breach notification and security requirements, determines the Data Sharing Process, and offers guidance when adding new agencies and changing or updating system processes. The Commissioner or chief executive for each participating agency signs the E-MOU to join P20 WIN.
- The **Data Sharing Agreement (DSA)** is a formal document between the data recipient and each Participating Agency once a Data Request has been approved. This document outlines the specific regulations that define how data are able to be used, responsibilities of each entity in the DSA, specific privacy and security requirements. Exhibits to the DSA include: the approved Data Request form, confidentiality agreements, data destruction certificates, and the E-MOU.
- The **Data Use License (DUL)** is a formal document between the Operating Group, the Data Integration Hub and the Data User.
