# Acceptable use

Cross-agency data sharing is for legitimate governmental purposes, which can include evidence-based policy-making, academic research to support the wellbeing of state residents, and mandated, periodic state reporting. Each Participating Agency and the Data Integration Hub can only use Data for the authorized Data Sharing Request purpose and no other purpose in accordance with applicable federal and state law, the P20Win E-MOU and the Data Sharing Agreement. No participating agency, person or entity can maintain, use, disclose or share Data in a manner inconsistent with the terms of the P20Win E-MOU or its Appendices and applicable federal and state laws and regulations. 
Upon completion of the approved project in a Data Request, all Data must be destroyed as determined by the Participating Agencies in the Data Sharing Agreement. In accordance with applicable law and the P20Win E-MOU, the Data Governing Board establishes the parameters for Data Transmission and Data destruction.
