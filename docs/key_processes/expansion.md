# Expansion of P20 WIN

The Executive Board approves a process for adding new state agencies or organizations or additional data so that the technical infrastructure can be expanded and new agencies have representation in the named committees. The process for a new agency to join P20 WIN can be found in Section 3 of this manual or in Appendix 1 of the eMOU.
